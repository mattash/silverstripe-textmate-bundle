# Silverstripe Textmate Bundle

Silverstripe is great MVC/CMS system, with a robust API. Are you always visiting the
[Silverstripe Documentation](http://doc.silverstripe.org/doku.php) to 
remember what a functions syntax was? Me too. That's why a Silverstripe 
Textmate bundle is a great timesaver.

## INSTALLATION

### For Textmate

1. `cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/`
2. if that directory wasn't found, you'll need to create it, then:
3. `git clone git://github.com/mattash/silverstripe-textmate-bundle.git "Silverstripe.tmbundle"`

### For E-Texteditor

These instructions assume your using Microsoft Vista or higher. From the Git Bash prompt 
do the following. If you use Git another way in Windows, then you be aware of the location
you should clone the repo into.

1. `cd Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\e\InstalledBundles`
2. `git clone git://github.com/mattash/silverstripe-textmate-bundle.git "Silverstripe.tmbundle" `

## Support & Contributing

If there is something broken, and their most likely is, feel free to submit an issue ticket. 

Even the better, go ahead and fork this repo, create a new branch and fix the problem, or add some
new features. Send a pull request and I'll merge it. _Just keep in mind_ that I'm trying keep this bundle
compatible with both Windows and Macs. Therefore, don't use any filenames with odd filenames that 
might not work on Windows.

## THANKS

This bundle is based on the [silverstripe textmate bundle](http://open.silverstripe.org/browser/tools/textmatebundle/trunk/PHP%20Silverstripe.tmbundle) 
originally developed by the [Silverstripe Team](http://www.silverstripe.org).
